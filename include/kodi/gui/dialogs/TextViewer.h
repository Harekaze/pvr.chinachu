    ///  "Notable for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and "
    ///  "unusual characters, over the years it has become an icon of American popular "
    ///  "culture. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture but "
    ///  "lost to Gone with the Wind. It did win in two other categories including Best "
    ///  "Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow\". However, the film was a box office "
    ///  "disappointment on its initial release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 "
    ///  "budget, despite receiving largely positive reviews. It was MGM's most "

    ///  "investment and turn a profit until theatrical re-releases starting in 1949.\n"
    ///  "\n"
    ///  "The 1956 broadcast television premiere of the film on CBS re-introduced the "
    ///  "film to the wider public and eventually made the presentation an annual "
    ///  "tradition, making it one of the most known films in cinema history. The "
    ///  "film was named the most-viewed motion picture on television syndication by "
    ///  "the Library of Congress who also included the film in its National Film "
    ///  "Registry in its inaugural year in 1989. Designation on the registry calls "
